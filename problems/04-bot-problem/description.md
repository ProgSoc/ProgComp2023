# Bot Problem

Our popular social media app has suddenly received a mass influx of spam bots! Our reliable sources say that 90% of comments are from bots. We need to fix this problem, and we need to fix it fast.

We've noticed a trend in the bot usernames: they always have a first name, last name, and 3 digits in that order. The first and last names are always capitalised. An example of this would be `JohnDoe123`.

We've collated a list of potential spam bot usernames, we need you develop a program which returns a list of usernames which match the above criteria.

## Input format

The first line contains a number `N` which is the number of usernames we've found as potential bots.

Proceeding this are `N` lines, each containing a username.

## Output format

Output the bot names in the order they were inputted, each on a new line.
