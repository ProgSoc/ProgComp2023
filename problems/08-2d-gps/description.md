# 2D GPS System Challenge

## Problem Description

You are tasked with designing a 2D GPS (Global Positioning System) system. The system receives three known coordinates, along with the distances from these coordinates to an unknown device's location. Your goal is to calculate the coordinates of the device based on this information.

The three known coordinates are represented by (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), and (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>). These coordinates correspond to three distinct locations on a 2D plane. Additionally, you are given the distances from the device to these three locations: d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, and d<sub>3</sub>.

Your task is to determine the exact (x, y) coordinate of the device. For simplicity, the inputs and outputs are all integers.
