# Eco Friendly Power Grid

A city plans to set up an eco-friendly power grid using renewable energy sources. The city can be modeled as a graph where each node is a building and each edge is a cable that can transmit power. The goal is to minimize cable length while ensuring each building either has a power source or is directly/indirectly connected to one. Given the coordinates of each building, determine the minimum length of cable required.
