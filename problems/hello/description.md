# Hello Programmers!

In this problem, you need to greet the name, except you must make sure the name is capitalized correctly.

The first letter must be capitalized, while the others must be lowercase.

So for example, `Linus`, `LINUS`, `liNuS` will all be converted to `Hello Linus!`.

## Input format

The first line contains a string `S` which is the name to be greeted.

S is at least one character long, and contains only letters.

## Output format

Output the greeting to the name.
