# Hello Programmers!

In this problem, you need to greet the name, except you must make sure the name is capitalized correctly.

The first letter must be capitalized, while the others must be lowercase.

So for example, `Linus`, `LINUS`, `liNuS` will all be converted to `Hello Linus!`.

All inputs are at least 1 character long.
