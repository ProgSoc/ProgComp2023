# Programming Competition 2023

Welcome to our programming competition of 2023! This website documents the questions along with how to get started with the competition.

## Runsheet

- 11:30 - Event start, teams set up
- 12:00 - Competition start
- 1:00 - Lunch comes (sandwiches/wraps)
- 3:00 - Scoreboard freeze
- 4:00 - Competition end, scoreboard unfreeze, announcing winners

## Solving questions

Each question requires reading from standard input (stdin) and printing to standard output (stdout). Just as an example, here's a simple python program that reads a line from standard input and then prints it out again:

```py
line = input()
print(line)
```

However, we've created a scaffold for each question that does that for you to make life easier.

We've prepared scaffolds for Python, Java and C++. You should be able to write code locally, test it with the sample inputs/outputs, then upload it to the competition server when you're done to mark it.

To upload a file, make sure you're logged in, then you should have a submit button in the top right. Click, then select your file and the question you're submitting for, and it should judge it from there.

## Scoring

There are 2 points systems:

1. The team with the most answered questions wins
2. If there is a tie, the second system is used:
  - Each time you answer a question, you get "points" for how many minutes passed between the beginning of the competition and when you solved it
  - Out of the tied teams, the team with the lowest total "points" wins

## Prizes

1st place: $1500
2nd place: $900
3rd place: $600
